# Todo List application
This is a simple todo list webapplication. Users can create a new account, login and create a list of todo items. The application also allows you to edit and delete existing todo items. This application was created to test my Angular skills, after I followed the [Angular 7 course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/overview). 

## Technologies
The backend of the webapplication uses ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. It uses AutoMapper to map database entities to DTO's and the other way around. I have also written several unit tests and integration tests for the backend. These tests use the xUnit framework and xUnit testrunner. The frontend was created using Angular and Bootstrap.
